Read through the [hardware design with rp2350](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/hardware-design-with-rp2350.pdf) document, and some of the rp2350 datasheet, and got started with the design.

Since the RP2350 supports dual SPI chips, i'm looking into adding an SPI EEPROM like the AT25M02 to the design, which will allow for more flexibility with storage.
